The TP-Link Omada SDN Controller lets you centrally manage access points, switches, and gateways with ease. This guide walks you through installing the latest Omada Controller on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, covering all required dependencies, installation steps, and verification so you can get your network up and running quickly.

Current version of Omada as of this writing is `5.15.24.19`. Let's Install Omada controller on latest LTS on Ubuntu. 

> If are trying to upgrade the Controller please check the instruction at [upgrade-omada-controller](/posts/upgrade-omada-controller). Make sure to adopt the instructions based on your version.
{: .prompt-info }

First update the apt repos and upgrade current packages. I'm Assuming here that Ubuntu 24.04 box is fresh install and nothing other than preinstalled with distro were installed.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

## Dependencies

For Debian systems, Omada need Java 8 or later, MongoDB 7, JSVC, curl, gnupg.

```shell
sudo apt install wget curl gnupg
```

Omada supports java 8 and above. if you just want to run Omada Controller and be done with that use java 8 otherwise you can go with java 21. Just keep in mind that you might need to troubleshoot errors, compile some packages yourself and did I mention log of troubleshooting.

### java

We are going to be using `openjdk-21 headless` with `jdk` instead of `jre`. 

```shell
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk-headless jsvc -y
```

### MongoDB

Omada supports MongoDB v7, let's install `gpg` key for` mongodb-org` `7.0`

```shell
curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-7.0.asc | \
sudo gpg -o /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg --dearmor
```

Now add mongodb-org repo for focal to the source list, create a new source file for mongodb v7 with the following

```shell
echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-server-7.0.gpg ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu jammy/mongodb-org/7.0 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list
```
{: file='/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-7.0.list'}

Update repo and install mongodb

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mongodb-org
```

## Install 

To install the Omada Controller, download the deb package from TP-Link support. Make sure to grab latest version [here](https://support.omadanetworks.com/us/product/omada-software-controller/?resourceType=download)

```shell
wget https://static.tp-link.com/upload/software/2025/202508/20250802/omada_v5.15.24.19_linux_x64_20250724152622.deb
```

Install the Omada controller. 

```bash
sudo dpkg -i omada_v5.15.24.19_linux_x64_20250724152622.deb
```

It might take 2 to 5 min depending upon your box configuration. Once the installation completed, visit `https://<ip>:8043`

## Post Install

To stop and run the controller

```bash
# stop command
sudo tpeap stop

# start command
sudo tpeap start

# restart command
sudo tpeap restart
```

## Uninstall

To uninstall the Omada controller, follow the prompts by running the following

```bash
sudo apt remove omadac
```

## Conclusion

With Omada SDN Controller now running on Ubuntu 24.04, you have a reliable setup to centrally manage your TP-Link devices.  

One thing to keep in mind is MongoDB: while Ubuntu 24.04 ships with MongoDB 7 by default, some users report compatibility issues with Omada. If you run into problems, you can still install MongoDB 4.4 by following the instructions in [my earlier guide for Ubuntu 22.04](/posts/omada-sdn-controller-ubuntu-22-04/#install-mongodb).  

From here, you can secure the controller with HTTPS, configure regular backups, and even automate deployments using Ansible or Docker. Keeping both Ubuntu and Omada updated will ensure long-term stability and security for your network.
