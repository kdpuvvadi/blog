Passwords can be tricky. They are hard to remember and easy to guess and easy to be stolen. And there is Human element and our stupid brains always wants use same or similar passwords for login on every other website, including social networks, Personal email and Works emails etc.

When it comes to WordPress, this can be more damaging. If your business website is compromised because of some weak password or any other human elements. Chance of password compromise increases with the number of people administrating the site.

If you remove the “PASSWORD” from the equation and setup password less login to your WordPress business website or your blog using WordPress it reduces the chance of password compromise. Keep in mind, though, it won’t protect from week firewall or Zero-day from poorly coded plugin or theme. You should always use security plugin. I personally recommend **secure**, it has great features and User friendly.

To start, your WordPress site should be already set up and you only need to install one plugin and no configuration or complicated API setups are not required.

**Trusona**, Security/authentication service used by Americal Federal Services like FBI, CIA, etc. to make sure said person is accessing the service. It is available to consumers free of charge.

Go to *Dashboard &gt; Plugins &gt; Add New* and Search for “trusona”

Click on Install and after instation, Activate. I’ve alredy installed the plugin and activated. WordPress side of things are done for now.
