## Introduction

Hugo is a popular static site generator that allows users to easily create and maintain a website by writing content in a simple markup language such as Markdown. In this blog post, we will go through the steps of installing Hugo, setting up a new site, starting the development server, and using version control with Git and GitHub. We will also cover deploying the site to CDN providers such as Cloudflare, Netlify, and Vercel.

## Installing Hugo

To install `Hugo`, you will need to have Go (version `1.14` or later) installed on your computer. If you do not have Go installed, you can follow the instructions on the Go website to install it.

Once Go is installed, you can use the following command to install Hugo:

```shell
go get -u github.com/gohugoio/hugo
```

This will install the latest version of Hugo and make it available on your computer.

## Setting up a new

To create a new Hugo site, use the following command:

```shell
hugo new site mysite
```

This will create a new directory called `mysite`" with the necessary files and directories for a new Hugo site.

Next, navigate to the new site directory and add a theme:

```shell
cd mysite
hugo new theme mytheme
```

This will create a new directory called "mytheme" with the necessary files and directories for a new Hugo theme.

Starting the development server
To start the development server, navigate to the root directory of your site and run the following command:

```shell
hugo server -D
```

This will start the development server and will automatically reload the site when changes are made to the content or templates. The site will be available at [http://localhost:1313/](http://localhost:1313/).

## Using version control with Git and GitHub

It is a good idea to use version control for your Hugo site, particularly if you are working with a team or if you want to track changes over time. Git is a popular version control system, and GitHub is a platform that allows you to host your Git repositories online.

To set up Git for your Hugo site, navigate to the root directory of your site and run the following commands:

```shell
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This will initialize a new Git repository for your site, add all of the files to the repository, and create an initial commit.

Next, create a new repository on GitHub and follow the instructions to push your local repository to the remote repository on GitHub.

## Deploy to Cloudflare Pages

To deploy a Hugo site to Cloudflare with environment variables for the Hugo and Node.js versions, you can use Cloudflare's continuous deployment feature to automatically build and deploy your site whenever you push changes to your Git repository. Here's how to do so:

- Sign up for a Cloudflare account and create a new site on Cloudflare Pages.
- Connect your Cloudflare Pages site to your Git repository.
- In the Cloudflare dashboard, go to the "Continuous Deployment" tab.
- Select the branch that you want to deploy from and configure any additional options as needed (such as the build command or environment variables).
- In the "Environment Variables" section, add the following environment variables:
  - `HUGO_VERSION`: The version of Hugo that you want to use.
  - `NODE_VERSION`: The version of Node.js that you want to use.
- Click "Save and Deploy" to start the deployment process.

Cloudflare will automatically build and deploy your site, using the specified `Hugo` and `Node.js` versions, whenever you push changes to your Git repository.

You can then use the environment variables in your Hugo templates or content files by accessing them through the `.Site.Params` variable.

For example, to access the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable, you can use the following code:

```go
{{ .Site.Params.HUGO_VERSION }}
```

## Deploying to netlify

- Sign up for a Netlify account and create a new site.
- Connect your Netlify site to your Git repository.
- In the Netlify dashboard, go to the "Deploys" tab.
- In the "Build & Deploy" section, select the "public" directory as the build directory and the "master" branch as the deploy branch.
- In the "Advanced" section, click on the "Edit variables" button to open the environment variables editor.
- Add the following environment variables:
  - HUGO_VERSION: The version of Hugo that you want to use.
  - NODE_VERSION: The version of Node.js that you want to use.
- Click "Save" to save the environment variables.
- Click "Deploy site" to start the deployment process.

Netlify will automatically build and deploy your site, using the specified `Hugo` and `Node.js` versions, whenever you push changes to your Git repository. You can then use the environment variables in your Hugo templates or content files by accessing them through the `.Site.Params` variable.

For example, to access the `HUGO_VERSION` environment variable, you can use the following code:

```go
{{ .Site.Params.HUGO_VERSION }}
```

## Deploying to Vercel

To deploy your site to Vercel, follow these steps:

- Sign up for a Vercel account and create a new project.
- Connect your project to the GitHub repository where your site's source code is stored.
- In the Vercel dashboard, go to the "Settings" tab.
- In the "Build & Deploy" section, select the "public" directory as the output directory.
- Click "Deploy" to start the deployment process.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, deploying a Hugo site to a CDN provider like Cloudflare, Netlify, or Vercel is a simple and efficient way to host a static site and make it available to users around the world. By using Git and GitHub for version control and continuous deployment, you can easily manage and update your site, and the CDN will ensure that it is delivered to users quickly and efficiently.

Using environment variables can also be useful for specifying the versions of tools like Hugo and Node.js that you want to use, and they can be easily accessed in your templates and content files to customize the behavior of your site.

Overall, using a CDN provider like Cloudflare, Netlify, or Vercel is a great way to host a Hugo site and keep it up-to-date with minimal effort.
